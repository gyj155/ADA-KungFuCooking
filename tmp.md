# A Dynamic Exploration of YouTube and Its Hidden Influences

Welcome to [our project](https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2024-project-kungfucooking), where data meets discovery. With metadata from over 136,000 YouTube channels, 72.9 million videos, and 8.6 billion comments, the [YouNiverse](https://github.com/epfl-dlab/YouNiverse/tree/master) dataset, opens a window into the intricate dynamics of YouTube—a platform that shapes public discourse, amplifies voices, and sometimes, distorts realities. At the heart of our journey lies a pressing question: How do conspiracy theories thrive in this vast digital ecosystem?

### Setting the Stage
Our research dives deep into the phenomenon of conspiracy theories, with a particular focus on the narratives propagated by Donald Trump. By analyzing millions of videos, we uncover the pathways through which these theories spread and evolve. From emotional engagement to amplified reach via mainstream and alternative channels, our findings illustrate the power of YouTube in shaping political and social discourse.

### The Questions That Drive Us
1. How did Trump leverage conspiracy theories to command attention on YouTube?
2. Do videos containing conspiracy theory keywords garner higher engagement (likes, dislikes, views) compared to others?
3. Are entertainment-focused Trump-related videos driving more views, and how do subscription patterns shift before and after their release?
4. How do conspiracy-related keywords in titles or tags, combined with entertainment categorization, influence a video's engagement metrics?

### A Treasure Trove of Data
The richness of our dataset—spanning millions of videos and billions of interactions—enabled us to focus on Trump-related content, divided into those with and without conspiracy theory keywords. This bifurcation allowed us to discern patterns, test hypotheses, and draw meaningful insights.

#### The Power of Conspiracy Keywords

1. **Engagement Metrics:**
   - Videos with conspiracy-related keywords achieve significantly higher views, likes, and dislikes compared to those without.
   - These videos also exhibit a higher like-to-dislike ratio, indicating stronger viewer approval.

2. **Behavioral Insights:**
   - People are more inclined to "like" such videos while demonstrating a reduced tendency to "dislike" them.

#### Temporal Dynamics and Sequential Pathways
1. **Content Peaks:**
   - October 2018 and November 2019 marked spikes in conspiracy-related video production, coinciding with significant political events: the U.S. midterm elections and impeachment discussions.

2. **Emerging Themes:**
   - From the *Deep State* and *QAnon* during the 2018 midterms to the *Biden Family Scandal* amid impeachment, these narratives reveal how political moments shape conspiracy discourse.

3. **Release Patterns:**
   - Trump-related conspiracy videos first appear in the "People & Blogs" category, followed by "News & Politics," and later, "Entertainment." This progression reflects the layered amplification of these narratives, from spontaneous public reactions to curated news coverage and finally, entertainment reinterpretations.

#### The Role of Entertainment
Our analysis revealed that:
- Entertainment videos with conspiracy keywords in their title or tags tend to receive fewer likes than non-entertainment or non-conspiracy counterparts. However, this observation may be influenced by sample size discrepancies and view count variances.
- Balancing the data shows that while engagement rates differ, the narrative's power to draw reactions remains undeniable.

### Why It Matters
YouTube is more than a platform; it is a reflection of society's deepest curiosities, fears, and beliefs. By understanding how conspiracy theories proliferate, we can better comprehend the mechanisms of influence and the role digital platforms play in shaping modern discourse. Our findings not only highlight the emotional power of conspiracy content but also underscore the need for awareness and responsibility in digital engagement.

### Looking Ahead
Through advanced analysis and balanced datasets, we aim to unravel the complexities of YouTube's role in political influence. From tracing temporal patterns to evaluating engagement metrics, our project invites you to journey with us as we illuminate the dynamics of digital influence—one video at a time.
