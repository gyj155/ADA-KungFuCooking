### Description
Welcome to our project, where data meets discovery. With metadata from over 136,000 YouTube channels, 72.9 million videos, and 8.6 billion comments, the YouNiverse dataset, opens a window into the intricate dynamics of YouTubeâ€”a platform that shapes public discourse, amplifies voices, and sometimes, distorts realities. At the heart of our journey lies a pressing question: How do conspiracy theories thrive in this vast digital ecosystem?
